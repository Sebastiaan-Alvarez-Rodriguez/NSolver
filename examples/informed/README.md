# Informed Solvers
Informed solvers use knowledge about the problem to work towards a solution.

The main advantage of informed solvers is their efficiency: These solvers are specifically tailored to solve one problem, and can optimize their strategies using the knowledge of this problem.

The main disadvantage of these algorithms is that they are only capable of solving one problem.
